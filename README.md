## üîê Secure Your Private Keys with Foundry‚Äôs Keystore

To keep your private keys safe, we‚Äôll use Foundry‚Äôs `cast wallet import` to encrypt them with a password. This is a critical security step! üîê

### Why This Is Important

Storing your private key in plain text (e.g., in the `.env` file) is dangerous. If someone accesses your computer, they can steal your funds.
Using `cast wallet import`, your private key is encrypted and stored securely on your computer, protected by a password. Only you can decrypt it with the password.

### Steps to Encrypt Your Private Key

#### Import Your PulseChain Private Key:
Run:
```bash
cast wallet import <KEYSTORE_NAME> --interactive
```
You‚Äôll be prompted to enter your private key (without the `0x` prefix) and a password.
Choose a strong password (e.g., at least 12 characters, mix of letters, numbers, and symbols). Write it down and store it securely (e.g., in a password manager or on paper in a safe place).

**Example:**
```text
Enter private key: <your-private-key>
Enter password: <your-strong-password>
Confirm password: <your-strong-password>
```
This creates an encrypted keystore file in `~/.foundry/keystores/`.

#### Import Your BNB Chain Private Key:
If you‚Äôre using a different private key for BNB Chain, repeat the process with a different name:
```bash
cast wallet import <BNB_KEYSTORE_NAME> --interactive
```
If you‚Äôre using the same private key for both chains, you can skip this step and use the same keystore name for both.

## üìù Create the `.env` File

The `.env` file stores your configuration settings. Let‚Äôs create it.

### Create the File:
In the `mafia-cron-scheduler` directory, create a file named `.env`:

- **Windows (WSL)/Linux/macOS:** Use a text editor like nano:
  ```bash
  nano .env
  ```
  Or create it manually in your file explorer.

### Add the Following Content:
Copy and paste this into your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your values:

```text
PLS_RPC_URL=https://rpc-pulsechain.g4mm4.io
BNB_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.bnbchain.org
PLS_KEYSTORE_NAME=<your-pls-keystore-name>
BNB_KEYSTORE_NAME=<your-bnb-keystore-name>
PLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<your-pls-keystore-password>
BNB_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<your-bnb-keystore-password>
CHAIN_CHOICE=2  # 0 -> PLS, 1 -> BNB, 2 -> BOTH
```

### Explanation:
- `PLS_RPC_URL`: The PulseChain RPC URL (default provided).
- `BNB_RPC_URL`: The BNB Chain RPC URL (default provided).
- `PLS_KEYSTORE_NAME`: The name of your PulseChain keystore (e.g., `MARCHESI`).
- `BNB_KEYSTORE_NAME`: The name of your BNB Chain keystore (e.g., `MARCHESI` or `MARCHESI_BNB`).
- `PLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: The password you set for your PulseChain keystore.
- `BNB_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: The password you set for your BNBChain keystore.
- `CHAIN_CHOICE`: Choose which chain(s) to run:
  - `0`: PulseChain only
  - `1`: BNB Chain only
  - `2`: Both chains

### Save and Exit:
If using nano, press `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl+X` to exit.

## üöÄ Run the Project

Now you‚Äôre ready to run the scheduler!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Script

Run the script to ensure everything works:
```bash
node run-train-script.js
```

You should see logs like:
```text
Scheduler started. Command will run every 50 minutes.
[2025-03-20T13:15:00.479Z] Running trainSkill command on PLS...
[2025-03-20T13:15:00.479Z] Running trainSkill command on BNB...
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run in the Background with pm2

Start the script with pm2:
```bash
pm2 start run-train-script.js
```

Save the pm2 process to ensure it runs on system startup:
```bash
pm2 save
```

View the logs to confirm it‚Äôs running:
```bash
pm2 logs run-train-script
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Updating Configuration

If you change the `.env` file (e.g., switch `CHAIN_CHOICE`), restart the pm2 process to apply the changes:
```bash
pm2 restart run-train-script
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Updating the Submodule

If the `mafia-scripts-foundry` submodule has been updated, run the following to get the latest changes:
```bash
cd mafia-scripts-foundry
git pull origin main
cd ..
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Then restart the pm2 process:
```bash
pm2 restart run-train-script
```

## üîí Best Security Practices

Security is critical when dealing with private keys and blockchain transactions. Follow these practices to stay safe:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Protect Your Private Keys

- **Never Share Your Private Key:** Your private key gives full access to your funds. Never share it with anyone, including the project maintainers.
- **Use Foundry‚Äôs Keystore:** By using `cast wallet import`, your private key is encrypted and stored securely. Only the password can decrypt it.
- **Choose a Strong Password:** Use a password that‚Äôs at least 12 characters long, with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols (e.g., `MySecurePass123!`).
- **Store Passwords Safely:** Write down your keystore password and store it in a secure place (e.g., a password manager like LastPass or a physical safe). Don‚Äôt store it on your computer in plain text.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Your `.env` File

- **Don‚Äôt Commit `.env` to Git:** The `.env` file contains sensitive data (like your keystore passwords). It‚Äôs already in `.gitignore`, so it won‚Äôt be committed to GitHub.
- **Restrict File Permissions:**
  - **Linux/macOS:** Run:
    ```bash
    chmod 600 .env
    ```
  - **Windows (WSL):** The above command works in WSL. On Windows itself, right-click the `.env` file, go to **Properties > Security**, and ensure only your user account has access.
  - **Backup Your `.env` File:** Copy it to a secure location (e.g., an encrypted USB drive) in case you lose it.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ General Security Tips

- **Keep Your System Secure:** Ensure your computer is protected with antivirus software and a firewall.
- **Use a Dedicated Account:** Consider using a separate wallet with a small amount of funds for this project, rather than your main wallet.
- **Monitor Logs:** Regularly check `pm2 logs run-trainskill` for errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Update Dependencies:** Keep Node.js, Foundry, and pm2 up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities:
  ```bash
  npm install -g npm
  foundryup
  npm install -g pm2
  ```

## üöß Troubleshooting

### Error: "forge: command not found":
- Ensure Foundry is installed (see the "Install Foundry" section).
- Run `foundryup` again.

### Error: "node: command not found":
- Ensure Node.js is installed (see the "Install Node.js" section).

### Transaction Reverts:
- This might be due to a cooldown period in the smart contract. Wait and try again, or check the contract logic if you have access.

### Logs Not Showing:
- Ensure pm2 is running:
  ```bash
  pm2 list
  ```
- View logs:
  ```bash
  pm2 logs run-trainskill
  ```

### Submodule Not Found:
- If you cloned the repo without submodules, initialize them:
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
